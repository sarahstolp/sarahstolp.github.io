I am a fifth-year PhD candidate advised by Celeste Kidd in the [Kidd Lab](https://www.kiddlab.com/) at UC Berkeley. I investigate the mechanisms that guide attention and their role in subsequent learning and decision-making. Using behavioral eye-tracking experiments and computational modeling, I study these mechanisms throughout development and across species.

I am especially interested in how human cognitive capacities shape our interactions with the technologies and systems we design. This interest informs my research in attention, focusing on how an attention-driven economy shapes the media we create and consume, and the impact it has on our behavior.
