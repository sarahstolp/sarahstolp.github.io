I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at UC Berkeley where I am advised by [Celeste Kidd](https://www.kiddlab.com/) in the Kidd Lab. My work investigates what features in the world around us guide our attention, and how what we pay attention to shapes what we subsequently learn. I conduct behavioral eye-tracking experiments with preschoolers, adults and dogs.
