I am a fourth-year PhD candidate advised by [Celeste Kidd][https://www.kiddlab.com/] at UC Berkeley, where I investigate the mechanisms that guide attention and their role in subsequent learning and decision-making. Using behavioral eye-tracking experiments and computational modeling, I study these mechanisms throughout development and across species. I am especially interested in how human cognitive capacities shape our interactions with the technologies and systems we design. This interest informs my research in attention, focusing on how an attention-driven economy shapes the media we create and consume, and the impact it has on our behavior.
